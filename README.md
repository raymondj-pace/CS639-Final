# Pace University
# CS 639 Mobile Application Development
# May 2023 Final Project

<br>

## The topic this semester is: *Pace Undergraduate Students’ Financial Literacy*

<br>

___
<br>

## **&#8226; Proposal:**

The goal of this project is to create an application that keeps track of money deductions (expenses) and additions. This type of application was listed at [Purdue Global](https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/student-life/budgeting-financial-literacy/) (part of Purdue University) as one of the five most important things to aid a student in keeping a budget:

<br>

> 3. List Your Expenses and Track Your Spending
> Next, you’ll want to list out all of your expenses over the course of your budget’s time span. You can estimate expenses
> by looking at past bank statements and credit card statements. Anticipate the costs of tuition, textbooks, school 
> supplies, transportation, and other costs.
> 
> Over the next month, record all of your purchases and add these to your budget, adjusting your original estimates as 
> necessary. It can be helpful to organize your expenses into different categories, such as education, food, housing, and 
> entertainment. Separating expenses into needs and wants can help you figure out where you can cut back.

<br>

<p>The goal of this app is to help students do exactly what Purdue Global recommends; record all purchases, income earned and track spending and overall budget.<br>

How a user will use the app, or the frequency of using the app, will depend on the student's needs:<br>

Student #1 has problems with running of money, bouncing checks and not being able to pay credit card minimum payments. Student #1 should focus on using the app at least daily if not for every deduction or addition of funds so that they have an up-to-date status.<br>

Student #2 wants to be sure that they do not turn into someone
  like Student #1, and they use the app less frequently depending on expenses. For example, Student #1 would likely need to enter every food purchase, but Student #2 could enter one entry for "Food Expenses" at the end of the week.<br>
  
The frequency of app usage is dependent on each user's needs.

### &#8226; Other budgeting apps include:

<br>
  
### **(1) _Rocket Money:_**

One of Rocket Money's main selling point is to be able to cancel subscriptions:

![Cons of Rocket Money](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94663542/235508497-02dde8d0-2f7e-474c-a098-7811aec84454.png)

<br>
<br>

### **(2) _Bill Shark:_**
![Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 2 15 12 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94663542/235504596-d973317d-8ccb-45d6-9cad-f7d51ea9be44.png)

<br>
<br>

### **(3) _Trim:_**
  
![Trim-app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94663542/235503450-5d47dcad-80e5-4909-920f-0fbc3c26b1c5.png)

<br>
<br>

## All 3 of these apps have similar features and a comparison of them is as follows:

![Comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94663542/235503899-f462db25-e693-46fa-aa33-433d03602880.png)

<br>
<br>

<p>While all three of these apps have nice features they also come with an expense, sometimes as high as 40% for any money that was saved by canceling or reducing bills. There is a slight predatory feeling with these apps. Users of these apps are looking to save money and the goal of the application developers are to earn money by encouraging the user to cancel subscriptions and then take upwards of 40% of what the user saved.<br>

The audience of our app is the undergraduate student that is likely living away from home for the first time and has likely never had to perform budgeting before. The undergraduate student typically lives on campus and does not have utility bills that they need to cancel or negotiate away via a third-party.<br>

The primary goal of our app is to give the student a simple and quick view of how much money they currently have. Other apps focus on multiple accounts including investment accounts and ours focuses on how much money they currently have "in their wallet". Our app does not discourage having multiple accounts. A user could enter a deduction as "$300, moved money to long-term savings account." Now this $300 does show up as available money and in fact is hidden from the users in that these other accounts are not a reminder of money that they have available to spend. The opposite is true of the student's credit card accounts. Any purchases made whether by cash or credit card will show as a deduction that needs to eventually be paid. It is too easy to hide debt by having multiple credit card accounts. Lastly, the desire for our app is that it would be made available for free at the university.</p>

# **Application Design and Prototype**

<br>

## &#8226; Application initial rough draft:
![CS639-RoughDraft](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94663542/232889561-7593f186-8f36-4eeb-b7f7-a465c3a3b712.jpg)

<br>

## &#8226; Application prototype done with Figma:
![FIGMA-prototype-v1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94663542/232889751-70d7418a-305b-44af-9fb3-aafe278f467e.png)

<br>
<br>
<br>

## &#8226; Internal Application Structure:
<p>The application uses multi-fragments with navigation. The main fragment uses a custom listview by creating an ArrayAdapter subclass so that each line within the listview can have its columns justified similar to an html table. The database uses Firebase to keep track of all transactions. The main fragment view shows the user's current balance. If the balance goes negative the balance will be shown in red.</p>

![Screen Shot 2023-05-01 at 1 01 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94663542/235493227-77d44918-77b9-413e-b092-f5771980b6b5.png)


<p>Transactions can be edited by clicking on the row and the child fragment will be prefilled.

The navigation uses safe-args and passes parcelable bundles by implementing the Parcelable interface. This was a difficult task because if your class is not implementing the Parcelable interface there is no error in Logcat to indicate this. A lot of digging was required to get passing Java objects between fragments working.</p>

<br>

## Interesting things learned:
How to put a border around a TextView by creating a drawable.<br>
How to modify the format of a listview to put in column format.<br>
How to make a listview clickable (not easy).<br>
How to pass custom Java objects between fragments while using host navigation AND implementing the Parcelable interface and creating bundles.<br>
How to update and delete a Firebase record by using the key value (must save the key value in the Java object).<br>
How to create an opening animation screen.<br>
How to work in a team using GitHub.<br>
How to add swipe-left support for delete action.<br>
<br>

## Things still *TODO*:
