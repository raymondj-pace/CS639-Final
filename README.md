# May 2023, CS639 Mobile Application Development, Final Project

## The topic this semester is: Pace Undergraduate Studentsâ€™ Financial Literacy

The goal of this project is to create an application that keeps track of money deductions (expenses) and additions. This type of application was listed at [Purdue Global](https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/student-life/budgeting-financial-literacy/) (part of Purdue University) as one of the five most important things to aid a student in keeping a budget.

### Internal Application Structure
<p>The application uses multi-fragment with navigation. The main fragment uses a custom listview by creating a BaseAdapter subclass so that each line within the listview can have its columns justified similar to an html table. The database uses Firebase to keep track of all transactions. The main fragment view shows the user's current balance. If the balance goes negative the balance will be shown in red.</p>

## Interesting things learned include:
How to put a border around a TextView by creating a drawable.<br>
How to modify the format of a listview.<br>
<br>
<br>

## Things still TODO:
Allow for line items to be deleted or edited from the list view.<br>
Allow the fragments to serialze Java objects between them to make the saving of data easier.
